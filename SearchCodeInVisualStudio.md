# 🔍 Code Search in Visual Studio

When debugging or exploring a large codebase, the following shortcuts can be extremely helpful:

---

### 🔁 `Shift + F12` — **Find All References**

* Click on a method, variable, or type.
* Press `Shift + F12` to **view all places where it is used**.
* Great for understanding how a method or class is being utilized across the solution.

---

### 🔎 `Ctrl + F` — **Text Search**

* Opens the **standard search bar**.
* You can search within:

  * Current document
  * Current project
  * Entire solution *(recommended for large-scale lookups)*

> 💡 Be sure to select the correct **search scope** — e.g., *"Entire Solution"* — to ensure you're not missing references in other files.

---

### 🚀 `Ctrl + F12` — **Go to Definition**

* Instantly jump to the **implementation** of a method, class, or interface.

---

### 🔙 `Ctrl + -` — **Go Back**

* Return to the **previous cursor position** after jumping to a definition.

---

### ⬆️ `Shift + F11` — **Step Out**

* While debugging: exit the **current method** and return to the calling method.
* Very useful if you stepped into a method by mistake.

---

### ⚡ `Ctrl + T` — **Quick Search (Go To Everything)**

* This is the **most powerful and recommended** search tool.
* Allows you to:

  * Jump to files (`f filename`)
  * Search by type, method, symbol, or line
  * Example: typing `GetTopStudents` instantly navigates to that method
* Smart filtering makes this ideal for fast navigation across large projects.
